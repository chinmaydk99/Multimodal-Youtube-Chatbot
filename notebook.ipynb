what's up? Today I'm going to show you how to make the mini. So stay with me and I will show you. Let's get it! So for this project we will need a small cabochon. In my case I have a small round labradorite cabochon. You can use also teardrops or whatever shape you want. So we will take some 14 gauge wire. This is half round wire. 14 gauge dead soft brass. We will use approximately this length of wire. And this is all we need to start the project. So with our nylon tip pliers we will secure the middle of the wire and start bending. So what we want is to have the flat side down and the half round side up. This is why we need the pliers, in order to stay like this, flat. Ok, a little more. What I like to use is my round pliers to give it a nice round shape. If you have these pliers it's good. You can use also the normal round nose pliers or whatever tool you have. If you have one of these you can use it to shape as long as it's round. Now we measure. The stone can still slip through it, so we will make it a bit smaller. Ok, this is enough. Now we will hold the stone and the wire with our thumb and bend one of the wires so it goes behind the stone, like this. And the other side as well. Like so. So what I like to do in order to have the wires to go flat behind the stone, I take the stone out and then with my flat nose wires I flatten the half round wires that go behind the stone, like this. So now our stone is secured into place and the wires go straight and sit flat in the back of the stone. With our flat nose pliers I mean, we will bend one of the wires to the inside, like this, and with our hand bend it straight up, like so. And repeat the same process on the other side. Inside and outside. This small gap here will help us secure the wires from the bail. Ok. Now we will need our second wire. So for this I use 22 gauge half round wire. We will need a very small amount. This will do. And wrap it four times around the two base wires. Cut the excess. And apply some pressure with your pliers. Like this. By the way, if you're enjoying this tutorial, don't forget to like the video and subscribe to the channel and hit the bell to receive the notification when there's a new tutorial. So, I like to use this tool, this is a file, just to make the bail. Ok? You can do it with your round nose pliers or whatever. And this is what I use. So we bend the two wires to the front, like this, and try to put them right in the middle. And with our fingers, our thumb here, we have to secure the wires here in the bail. And with one hand, bend one of the wires to the outside. Like so. And repeat the same process on the other side. Yeah, that's it. So it's important that the wires we're bending, they go on top of the first curve we made, ok? So that it secures it and it cannot come off. So now, with the nylon tip pliers, we apply some pressure here so that everything is tight and into place and the stone doesn't move anymore. So, following the same example as before, we secure with our fingers here the bail and bend as tight as we can the wire so that it goes behind the stone, like this, and then bend it up to have it go in this place here, because this is where we are going to secure the wire. So, with our pliers, we cut here just enough space to bend the wire and secure it to the bail. So for this, we're going to make a close-up. Yeah, that's it. That's it. So, needle-nose pliers. Here we bend to the inside and then we apply some pressure to secure it. And the same for the other side. So, we secure strongly with our fingers and then we bend the wire tight so it goes behind the pendant and we shape it to go on that sweet spot. Same thing, we cut the excess and we secure that little piece of wire to the bail. Now, if your stone still moves after this, you can always apply some pressure here with your pliers. I use the nylon tip because they don't leave marks. And this is it. Here we have our mini. What I like about this pendant is that the back is very soft and it will never get caught in your clothes and also it will be very soft on your skin. They're very fast to do. If you're not explaining how to do it, you can make it in about 5 to 10 minutes and they're very elegant and easy to wear and also very light. And here are a few more examples. This one has an oval shape. This is a teardrop shape. And this is a mini-mini, so it's quite smaller than the other ones, but you can play around. So, I hope you enjoyed this tutorial. Let me know down in the comments what kind of tutorial you would like to see me doing next. You can follow me on Instagram and Facebook. I will leave the links down below in the description. And also, if you're interested, I have a few PDF tutorials on my website, so I will leave the link also in the description. So, that being said, have a beautiful day and see you in the next video.

So now, with the nylon tip pliers, we apply some pressure here so that everything is tight and into place and the stone doesn't move anymore. So, following the same example as before, we secure with our fingers here the bail and bend as tight as we can the wire so that it goes behind the stone, like this, and then bend it up to have it go in this place here, because this is where we are going to secure the wire. So, with our pliers, we cut here just enough space to bend the wire and secure it to the bail. So for this, we're going to make a close-up. Yeah, that's it. That's it. So, needle-nose pliers. Here we bend to the inside and then we apply some pressure to secure it. And the same for the other side. So, we secure strongly with our fingers and then we bend the wire tight so it goes behind the pendant and we shape it to go on that sweet spot. Same thing, we cut the excess and we secure that little piece of wire to the bail. Now, if your stone still moves after this, you can always apply some pressure here with your pliers. I use the nylon tip because they don't leave marks. And this is it. Here we have our mini. What I like about this pendant is that the back is very soft and it will never get caught in your clothes and also it will be very soft on your skin. They're very fast to do. If you're not explaining how to do it, you can make it in about 5 to 10 minutes and they're very elegant and easy to wear and also very light. And here are a few more examples. This one has an oval shape. This is a teardrop shape. And this is a mini-mini, so it's quite smaller than the other ones, but you can play around. So, I hope you enjoyed this tutorial. Let me know down in the comments what kind of tutorial you would like to see me doing next. You can follow me on Instagram and Facebook. I will leave the links down below in the description. And also, if you're interested, I have a few PDF tutorials on my website, so I will leave the link also in the description. So, that being said, have a beautiful day and see you in the next video.
